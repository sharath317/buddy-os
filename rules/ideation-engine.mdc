# 💡 Autonomous Ideation Engine

Buddy maintains a background Ideation Queue that discovers, prioritizes, and executes improvement ideas.

## Idea Sources

### 1. Manual Input

```bash
/buddy idea "Refactor payment hooks for testability"
```

Creates idea in `.cursor/ideas/backlog/` with metadata.

### 2. Repo Signals (Auto-Detected)

| Signal | Detection | Idea Type |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| High churn (>50 commits/6mo) | `/churn-map` | Refactoring |
| Missing tests in critical paths | Coverage analysis | Testing |
| Large files (>300 LOC) | File scan | Splitting |
| Deprecated dependencies | `npm outdated` | Upgrade |
| Bundle contributors >100KB | Bundle analysis | Optimization |

### 3. Slack Pain Points (When MCP Connected)

```python
PAIN_KEYWORDS = [
    "bug", "broken", "slow", "annoying",
    "workaround", "hate", "frustrating",
    "should be", "wish we could"
]

# Extract from monitored channels
for message in slack_messages:
    if any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in PAIN_KEYWORDS):
        create_idea(source="slack", content=message)
```

### 4. Market Patterns

Tracked in `.cursor/ideas/sources/market-trends.md`:

- React/Next.js releases
- WCAG updates
- Performance best practices
- Security advisories

### 5. Metrics Monitoring

| Metric | Threshold | Idea Type |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Bundle size growth >5% | Build comparison | Optimization |
| Test coverage drop >3% | Coverage delta | Testing |
| Performance regression | Lighthouse | Optimization |
| Error rate increase | Monitoring | Bug fix |

## Priority Scoring Formula

```
Priority Score = (Impact × Urgency) / Effort

Where:
- Impact: 1-10 (business value)
- Urgency: 1-10 (time sensitivity)
- Effort: 1-10 (implementation cost, inverted)
```

### Impact Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Affects critical path (payment, booking) | +3 |
| Reduces tech debt | +2 |
| Improves DX | +2 |
| Performance improvement | +2 |
| Security fix | +4 |
| Accessibility improvement | +2 |

### Urgency Weights

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Blocking someone | +4 |
| Due date approaching | +3 |
| Regression from recent change | +3 |
| Market pressure (competitor) | +2 |
| Slack mentions >3 | +2 |

### Effort Estimation

| Complexity | Effort Score | Time |
|------------|--------------|------|
| Trivial | 1 | <1 hour |
| Low | 3 | 1-4 hours |
| Medium | 5 | 1-2 days |
| High | 7 | 3-5 days |
| Massive | 10 | >1 week |

## Decision Contract (Required)

Every idea in READY state must have:

```yaml
---
id: IDEA-XXX
title: "Brief description"
source: manual | repo | slack | market | metrics
category: performance | dx | architecture | a11y | security
status: ready
priority_score: 8.5
---

## Decision Contract

### Blast Radius
- Files to modify: X
- Files to create: Y
- Downstream imports: Z
- Risk Level: 🟢 LOW | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔴 HIGH

### PR Risk Score: X/10
- Code gravity: X
- Coupling: X
- Churn history: X
- Review complexity: X

### Success Metric
- Primary: "Specific, measurable outcome"
- Secondary: "Supporting metric"
- Timeline: "When we'll know if it worked"

### Trust Level: L2
- Buddy can: Draft implementation
- Buddy cannot: Commit without review
- Human gate: Review before merge

### Effort Estimate
- Implementation: X hours
- Review: X hours
- Testing: X hours
- Total: X days
```

## Commands

### View Ideas

```bash
/buddy ideas              # List top 5 by priority
/buddy ideas all          # List all in backlog
/buddy ideas ready        # List ideas ready for work
```

### Add Idea

```bash
/buddy idea "Description of improvement"
```

### Scan for Ideas

```bash
/buddy ideas scan         # Run all detection sources
/buddy ideas scan repo    # Repo signals only
/buddy ideas scan market  # Market trends only
```

### Work on Idea

```bash
/buddy ideas work IDEA-004  # Start implementation
```

### Review Completed

```bash
/buddy ideas review       # See completed drafts
```

## Weekly Digest

Added to `/buddy` output on Mondays:

```
💡 IDEAS THIS WEEK
├─ 📥 New: 3 ideas captured
├─ ⭐ Top Priority: IDEA-003 (WCAG 2.2 Audit)
│   └─ Impact: High | Effort: Medium | Score: 8.5
├─ 🔄 In Progress: IDEA-001 (React 19 Compiler)

Quick: /buddy ideas for full list
```

## Trust Boundaries

| Action | Trust Level | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Capture idea | L1 | Silent, automatic |
| Score idea | L1 | Silent, automatic |
| Create implementation plan | L2 | Show as [DRAFT] |
| Execute implementation | L2 | Present for review |
| Commit changes | L3 | Requires confirmation |
| Merge changes | L4 | Always requires approval |

## Never Auto-Activate

```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Ideas are NEVER auto-executed to completion.

- Ideas appear as [DRAFT] first
- Require role-appropriate approval
- Post-completion impact measurement is mandatory
- Rules drafted from ideas are NEVER auto-enabled
```

## State Tracking

Ideas tracked in `.cursor/buddy-state.json`:

```json
{
  "ideation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "last_scan": "2025-12-28T12:00:00",
    "backlog_count": 7,
    "ready_count": 3,
    "in_progress_count": 0,
    "completed_this_week": 1,
    "top_priority": "IDEA-003"
  }
}
